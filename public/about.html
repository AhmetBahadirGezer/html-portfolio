<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a senior computer engineering student at Erciyes University. During my
  university education, I made small experiments in many fields to find the
  appropriate field for myself. I won a scholarship from a 6 month .Net Core
  bootcamp and completed it. I was active in many clubs and took part in
  teamwork. I supported social responsibility projects. I have been interested
  in sports as a hobby from a young age. Since high school, I have been
  interested in areas such as digital drawing and photo-video-editing. I am
  currently also interested in areas such as stock exchange and e-commerce. I am
  a detailed person. I try to do my best in the projects I am involved in. I am
  currently doing my graduation project on web development. I am looking for an
  internship where I can improve myself in web technologies.
